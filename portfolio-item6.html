            <p>Home, it is the place where one fancies or desires to be after a long tiring day. People come home exhausted after a long hard working day. Some are way too tired that they find it hard to move once they land on their couch, sofa or bed. So any small device/technology that would help them switch theirs lights on or off, or play their favourite music etc. on a go with their voice with the aid of their smart phones would make their home more comfortable.
                Moreover, it would be better if everything such as warming bath water and adjusting the room temperature were already done before they reach their home just by giving a voice command. So, when people would arrive home, they would find the room temperature, the bath water adjusted to their suitable preferences, and they could relax right away and feel cozier and rather, feel more homely.

            <p><strong>Major Components used:</strong>
                This paper proposes such inexpensive system. It uses the Google Assistant, the IFTTT application, the Blynk application and the NodeMCU microcontroller as the major components along with a relay board comprising of 4/8 relays. Natural language voice is used to give commands to the Google Assistant. All of the components are connected over the internet using WiFi which puts this system under the IoT.  </p>
            <p><strong>SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION :</strong>
                The system design is broken down into two main categories, <br>
 i. The hardware- It has the capability to connect to the router. It would also be able to turn on/off specified devices, such as lights and fans. It is called the ‘Control Unit’. And,<br>
 ii. The Software- The Blynk app, the IFTTT app and the Google Assistant constitute the software of the design and these applications would be integrated in the Android device.
