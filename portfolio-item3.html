            <p>Ever heard of Hugh Herr? He is a famous American rock climber who has shattered the limitations of his disabilities; he is a strong believer that technology could help disabled persons to live a normal life. In one of his TED talk Herr said <strong>“Humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment, our technologies, is broken and disabled. We the people need not accept our limitations, but can transfer disability through technological Innovation”</strong>. These were not just words but he lived his life to them, today he uses Prosthetic legs and claims to live to normal life. So yes, technology can indeed neutralize human disability; with this in mind let us use some simple devlopment boards and sensors to build an ultrasonic blind walking stick using Arduino that could perform more than just a stick for visually impaired persons.</p>

            <img src="img/w32.jpg" alt="">
            
            <p><strong>Design:</strong>
                The stick has been designed using Solid Work
                    software. The electric circuit was simulated using Proteus software for designing and simulating electrical circuits.
                    We have used three ultrasonic sensors. One sensor has been placed in front of the stick and the other
                    two have been placed on both sides, left and right. To detect the motion from almost every side, it has been used
                    vibrating motor and buzzer alarms to alert the person if some obstacle is detected near him.
                </p>
            <p><strong>Principle:</strong>
                The smart blind stick automatically detects the obstacle in front of the person and give him a response to the person by vibrating the stick and also with a warning sound. Through this, the blind person can aware about the obstacles in front of him. I used Ultrasonic sensor for detecting the obstacles.</p>
